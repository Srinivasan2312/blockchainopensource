# Key Concepts

## **Introduction**
A blockchain is a digital record of transactions. The name comes from its structure, in which individual records, called blocks, are linked together in single list, called a chain. Blockchains are used for recording transactions made with cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, and have many other applications.

Each transaction added to a blockchain is validated by multiple computers on the Internet. These systems, which are configured to monitor specific types of blockchain transactions, form a peer-to-peer network. They work together to ensure each transaction is valid before it is added to the blockchain. This decentralized network of computers ensures a single system cannot add invalid blocks to the chain.

## **Blockchain network**
A blockchain is a network. A network is a group or system of connected people or things. The computers or devices on the network, known as nodes, make up a blockchain network.The networks we use today are centralized. This means that they have a central point, where all information flows in and out from. One of the reasons that this is not good is because whoever controls this central point has full control over network data and users.

A blockchain network is different from a normal network because it does not have one central point that stores and controls information. Instead, the responsibility to look after the network and store information is shared by different devices, known as peers, on that network. This is why a blockchain network is known as a peer-to-peer network, shortened to P2P. The name comes from the fact that the tasks and responsibilities of maintaining the network are continuously shared from peer to peer.
